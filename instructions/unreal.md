Congratulations! You're almost set to start submitting renders to Conductor from within Unreal Engine.

1. Open Unreal and enable the Conductor plugin from the Plugins Window. 
2. In order to access the Conductor plugin, you'll need to enable the "Show Engine Content" and "Show Plugin Content" options in the Content Browser.
3. Browse to the BP_Conductor blueprint, right-click, and select "Run Editor Utility Widget" to open the Conductor plugin window.
4. Hit the "Connect" button to authenticate with your Conductor account. If you take too long it may timeout. In that case just hit "Connect" again.
