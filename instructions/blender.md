Almost there! You just need to tell Blender where to find the Conductor plugin.

* Relaunch Blender and navigate to Edit->Preferences->Add-ons.
* In case you can't locate the "Render: Conductor Render Submitter" Add-on, simply click the "Refresh" button.
* Proceed to enable the "Render: Conductor Render Submitter" Add-on.
* Switch over to the "Rendering" workspace, where you'll find the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel.
* Finally, within the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel, click on "Connect."

As an alternative method:

* Relaunch Blender and navigate to Edit->Preferences->Add-ons.
* Click on the "Install" button, then browse to {{installPath}}/conductor_submitter_plugin.py.
* After selecting the file, hit "Install Add-on" and make sure to enable the "Render: Conductor Render Submitter" Add-on.
* Switch over to the "Rendering" workspace, where you'll find the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel.
* Finally, within the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel, click on "Connect."
