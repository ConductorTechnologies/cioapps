Almost there! You just need to tell Blender where to find the Conductor plugin.

* Open Blender and go to Edit->Preferences->Add-ons.
* Click Install, and browse to {{installPath}}/conductor_submitter_plugin.py.
* Click "Install Add-on", then enable the Add-on "Conductor Render Submitter".
* Click on the "Rendering" workspace, and you should see the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel.
* On the "Conductor Render Submitter" panel, click on "Connect".
